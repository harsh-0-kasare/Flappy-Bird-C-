# 📌 ABSTRACT

This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using C++ and WinBGIm graphics library.  
The objective of the game is to control a bird, avoid obstacles (pipes), and score maximum points.

This project demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Real-time animation
- Collision detection
- Keyboard interaction
- Dynamic memory management

---

# 🎯 OBJECTIVES

# 🧠 GAME LOGIC

### Bird Movement
- Gravity pulls bird downward
- SPACE applies upward force

### Pipe System
- Pipes move continuously
- Random height generation
- Score increases when bird passes pipe

### Collision Detection
Game ends when:
- Bird hits pipe
- Bird touches ground

# 🔄 GAME FLOW

1. Start Screen displayed
2. Player presses SPACE to start
3. Bird moves continuously
4. Pipes generate randomly
5. Score increases
6. Collision → Game Over
7. Restart option

---

# 📊 ALGORITHM

1. Initialize graphics mode
2. Load background image
3. Create Bird and Pipe objects
4. Start game loop
5. Detect key press
6. Update bird position using gravity
7. Move pipe
8. Check collision
9. Update score
10. If collision → show Game Over
11. Restart or exit
